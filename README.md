# Entropic Dual Averaging
The repository contains an implemention of Entropic Dual Averaging algorithm for nonlinear systems modeling with the help of Volterra series. 

Scripts *experiment.py* and *experiment_different_stepsizes.py* test the algorithm on [the cascaded tanks benchmark](https://sites.google.com/view/nonlinear-benchmark/benchmarks/cascaded-tanks) and generate plots that have been used in **_Adaptive Entropic Dual Averaging Algorithm  for On-line Nonlinear System Modeling_** paper by **Szymon Łagosz**, **Paweł Wachel** and **Przemysław Śliwiński** affiliated with **Wrocław University of Technology**. 

# Requirements
The code was tested with Python 3.5.2

Install required python packages using:
 ```
